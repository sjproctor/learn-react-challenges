# 🌮 Challenge: Food Ordering App

As a developer, you are tasked with creating a food ordering application in React. This is the first iteration of an application that is going to be much larger in the future so it is important to create a solid foundation from which the code base can grow.

The menu UI will be in its own component as will the order UI. `App.js` controls of all the data in state, renders the other components, and passes data to the menu and the order component.

### 📚 User Stories

- As a user, I can see an application that has a list of food items and the price of each item.
  - Hint: Take some time to think about the data structure that will allow you to effectively store the required information.
- As a user, I can click a button to select an item I wish to order.
- As a user, I can see the items I have selected to order displayed on the page.

### 🏔 Stretch Goals

- As a user, I can see the total cost of my current order.
- As a user, I can see both the base total cost of my food selections and the total that includes sales tax.
- As a user, I can see the total that includes sales tax rounded to two decimals.
- As a user, I can see an image of my food selection on the menu.
