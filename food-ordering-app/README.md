# 🌮 Challenge: Food Ordering App

As a developer, you are tasked with creating a food ordering application. The application will allow the user to select items to order. As the user selects items, each item gets added to a cart.

When creating a project it is important to think about organization of your code. It is best practice to separate and compartmentalize all the actions in your code.

--> The dice UI will be in its own component as will the roll log UI. `App.js` controls of all the data in state, renders the other components, and passes data to the dice and roll component.

### 📚 User Stories

- As a user, I can see a selection of menu items and their corresponding price
- As a user, I can see a button to select each menu item
- As a user, I can see
- As a user, when I select an item I wish to order I can see the menu item displayed in the cart

### 🏔 Stretch Goals

As a user, I can see the total cost of my current order
As a user, I can see both the base total of my food selections and the total that includes sales tax
As a user, I can see the total that includes sales tax rounded to two decimals
