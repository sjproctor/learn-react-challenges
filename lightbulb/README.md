# üí° Challenge: Light Bulb

As a developer, you are tasked with creating a light switch application. The application will display an image of a lightbulb and corresponding switch. When the user clicks the switch the images will toggle between a light switch and bulb that are "off" and a light switch and bulb that are "on".

### üìö User Stories

- As a user, I can see a square box on the screen with a black border and a white background.
- As a user, I can see the word "off" inside the box.
- As a user, every time I click on the box the word toggles between the word "off" and the word "on."
- As a user, when I see the word "off" the background color of the box is white.
- As a user, when I see the word "on" the background color of the box is yellow.
- As a user, I can see many boxes on the page all acting independently of one another.
- As a user, instead of seeing a box I can see a picture of a light switch in the "off" position.
- As a user, when I click on the light switch it turns "on".
- As a user, when the light switch is "off" I see a white light bulb.
- As a user, when I turn the switch "on" I see a yellow light bulb.

### üèî Stretch Goals

- As a user, I can start with no light bulbs or switches on the screen.
- As a user, I can see a button to add a light bulb and corresponding switch.
- As a user, I can see a button to remove a light bulb and corresponding switch.
- As a user, every time I click the add button, I can add an additional light bulb and corresponding switch that acts independently of the other light bulbs and corresponding switches.
- As a user, every time I click the remove button, I can remove the last light bulb and corresponding switch in the series.
