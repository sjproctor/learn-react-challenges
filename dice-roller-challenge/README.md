# üé≤ Challenge: Dice Roller

As a developer, you are tasked with creating a dice application. The application will allow the user to role a standard six-sided dice and see the result of each roll. As the user rolls the dice, each roll gets logged creating a list of all the previous rolls.

When creating a project it is important to think about organization of your code. It is best practice to separate and compartmentalize all the actions in your code. The dice UI will be in its own component as will the roll log UI. `App.js` controls of all the data in state, renders the other components, and passes data to the dice and roll component.

### üìö User Stories

- As a user, I can see a square box on the screen with a black border and a white background
- As a user, I can click on the box to roll the dice and see the result of my roll in the box
- As a user, I can see my roll logged and see the roll log continue to grow as I roll the dice

### üèî Stretch Goals

- As a user, I can see the image of a dice face when I roll the dice
- As a user, I can click a restart button that clears my roll log
